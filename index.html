<p>I have created a simple app using Python 2.7 and wxPython that checks the price of the Bitcoin price and changes the background color to show if it went up or down from the last trade. You can also make a chart with a drop-down menu of some time frames. The app was made for windows, but the app should work on other platforms with minor tweaks to the frame and positioning of widgets. You can select how often you want it to update and in what currency you want it in. The BTC quotes are from coindesk.com/price</p>

<a id="the-code" class="anchor" href="#the-code" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Code</h3>

<p>I tried to comment as much as possible so it is easy to pick up if you want to add your own features to it. I have two code files for the project, one for the main frame and one for the settings panel.</p>

<h3>
<a id="how-do-i-download-it" class="anchor" href="#how-do-i-download-it" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How do I download it?</h3>

<p>All you need to do is either clone the repository or download it as a zip and install Python 2.7 with the module wxPython if you computer doesn't already have it. I will have the packaged .exe version as soon as possible and I will post the link as soon as I put it up.</p>
